The data includes multiple datatypes, including integers (year of construction), discrete labels (roof type), floating point numbers, etc.; Some data is missing and is thus labeled 'na'.

    "\n",
    "The k-fold cross-validation was introduced in the section where we discussed how to deal with [“Model Selection, Underfitting and Overfitting\"](underfit-overfit.md). We will put this to good use to select the model design and to adjust the hyperparameters. We first need a function that returns the i-th fold of the data in a k-fold cros-validation procedure. It proceeds by slicing out the i-th segment as validation data and returning the rest as training data. Note - this is not the most efficient way of handling data and we would use something much smarter if the amount of data was considerably larger. But this would obscure the function of the code considerably and we thus omit it."

Finding a good choice can take quite some time, depending on how many things one wants to optimize over. Within reason the k-fold crossvalidation approach is resilient against multiple testing. However, if we were to try out an unreasonably large number of options it might fail since we might just get lucky on the validation split with a particular set of hyperparameters."

    "Note for converting this notebook into PDF. If you use 'File -> Download as -> PDF', you may get the error that svg cannot converted because inkscape is not installed and cannot find PNG images. The easiest way is printing this notebook as a PDF in your browser. Or, you can install inkscape to convert SVG (On macOS, you may `brew cask install xquartz inkscape`, on Ubuntu, you may `sudo apt-get install inkscape`) and change the image URL to local filenames. "
