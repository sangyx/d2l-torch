    "The universe is overflowing with information. Information provides a common language across disciplinary rifts: from Shakespeare’s Sonnet to researchers’ paper on Cornell ArXiv, from Van Gogh’s printing Starry Night to Beethoven’s music Symphony No. 5, from the first programming language Plankalkül to the state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms. Everything must follow the rules of information theory, no matter the format. With information theory, we can measure and compare how much information is present in different signals. In this section, we will investigate the fundamental concepts of information theory and applications of information theory in machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, let us outline the relationship between machine learning and information theory. Machine learning aims to extract interesting signals from data and make critical predictions.  On the other hand, information theory studies encoding, decoding, transmitting, and manipulating information. As a result, information theory provides fundamental language for discussing the information processing in machine learned systems. For example, many machine learning applications use the cross entropy loss as described in :numref:`sec_softmax`.  This loss can be directly derived from information theoretic considerations. \n",

    "## Information\n",
    " \n",
    "Let us start with the \"soul\" of information theory - information. *Information* can be encoded in anything with a particular sequence of one or more encoding formats. Suppose we task ourselves with trying to define a notion of information.  What could be are starting point?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following thought experiment.  We have a friend with a deck of cards.  They will shuffle the deck, flip over some cards, and tell us statements about the cards.  We will try to assess the information content of each statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, they flip over a card and tell us, \"I see a card.\"  This provides us with no information at all.  We were already certain that this was the case so we hope the information should be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, they flip over a card and say, \"I see a heart.\"  This provides us some information, but in reality there are only $4$ different suits that were possible, each equally likely, so we are not surprised by this outcome.  We hope that whatever the measure of information, this event should have low information content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, they flip over a card and say, \"This is the $3$ of spades.\"  This is more information.  Indeed there were $52$ equally likely possible outcomes, and our friend told us which one it was.  This should be a medium amount of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us take this to the logical extreme.  Suppose lastly that they flip over every card from the deck and read off the entire sequence of the shuffled deck.  There are $52!$ different orders to the deck, again all equally likely, so we need a lot of information to know which one it is.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any notion of information we develop must conform to this intuition.  Indeed, in the next sections we will learn how to compute that these events have $0\\text{ bits}$, $2\\text{ bits}$, $~5.7\\text{ bits}$, and $~225.6\\text{ bits}$ of information respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we read through these thought experiments, we see a natural idea.  As a starting point, rather than caring about the knowledge, we may build off the idea that information represents the degree of surprise or the abstract possibility of the event. For example, if we want to describe an unusual event, we need a lot information. For a common event, we may not need much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1948,  [Claude E. Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) published his well-known book [A Mathematical Theory of Communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Mathematical_Theory_of_Communication) establishing the theory of information.  In his book, Shannon introduced the concept of information entropy for the first time. We will begin our journey here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Self-information\n",
    "\n",
    "Since information embodies the abstract possibility of an event, how do we map the possibility to the number of bits? Shannon introduced the term *bit*, which Shannon credited to John Tukey, as the unit of information. So what is a \"bit\" and why do we use it to measure information? Historically, an antique transmitter can only send or receive two codes, $0$ and $1$.  Indeed binary encoding is still in common use on all modern digital computers. In this way, any information is encoded by a series of $0$ and $1$. And hence, a series of binary digits of length $n$ contains $n$ bits of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose that for any series of codes, each $0$ or $1$ occurs with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$. Hence, an event $X$ with a series of codes of length $n$, occurs with a probability of $\\frac{1}{2^n}$. At the same time, as we mentioned before, this series contains $n$ bits of information. So, can we generalize to a math function which can transfer the probability $p$ to the number of bits? Shannon gave the answer by defining *self-information*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(X) = - \\log_2 (p)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "as the *bits* of information we have received for this event $X$. Note that we will always use base-2 logarithms in this section. For the sake of simplicity, the rest of this section will omit the subscript 2 in the logarithm notation, i.e., $\\log(.)$ always refers to $\\log_2(.)$. For example, the code \"0010\" has a self-information\n",
    "\n",
    "$$I(\\text{``0010\"}) = - \\log (p(\\text{``0010\"})) = - \\log \\left( \\frac{1}{2^4} \\right) = 4 \\text{ bits}.$$\n",

    "### Motivating Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us try to get specific about what we want.  This will be an informal statement of what are known as the *axioms of Shannon entropy*.  It will turn out that the following collection of common-sense statements force us to a unique definition of information.  [This survey paper](https://www.mdpi.com/1099-4300/10/3/261/pdf) provides a formal version of these axioms, along with several others.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  The information we gain by observing a random variable does not depend on what we call the elements, or the presence of additional elements which have probability zero.\n",
    "2.  The information we gain by observing two random variables is no more than the sum of the information we gain by observing them separately.  If they are independent, then it is exactly the sum.\n",
    "3.  The information gained when observing (nearly) certain events is (nearly) zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "While proving this fact is beyond the scope of our text, it is important to know that this uniquely determines the form that entropy must take.  The only ambiguity that these allow is in the choice of fundamental units, which is most often normalized by making the choice we saw before that the information provided by a single fair coin flip is one bit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "For any random variable $X$ that follows a probability distribution $P$ with a probability density function (p.d.f.) or a probability mass function (p.m.f.) $p(x)$, we measure the expected amount of information through *entropy* (or *Shannon entropy*)\n",

    "### Interpretations\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be curious: in the entropy definition, why we use an expectation of a negative logarithm? Here are some intuitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, why do we use a *logarithm* function $\\log$? Suppose that $p(x) = f_1(x) f_2(x) \\ldots, f_n(x)$, where each component function $f_i(x)$ is independent from each other. This means that each $f_i(x)$ contributes independently to the total information obtained from $p(x)$. As discussed above, we. want the entropy formula to be additive over independent random variables. Luckily, $\\log$ can naturally turn a product of probability distributions to a summation of the individual terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, why do we use a *negative* $\\log$? Intuitively, more frequent events should contain less information than less common events, since we often gain more information from an unusual case than from an ordinary one. However, $\\log$ is monotonically increasing with the probabilities, and indeed negative for all values in $[0,1]$.  We need to construct a monotonically decreasing relationship between the probability of events and their entropy, which will ideally be always positive (for nothing we observe should force us to forget what we have known). Hence, we add a negative sign in front of $\\log$ function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Last, where does the *expectation* function come from? Consider a random variable $X$. We can interpret the self-information ($-\\log(p)$) as the amount of *surprise* we have at seeing a particular outcome.  Indeed, as the probability approaches zero, the surprise becomes infinite.  Similarly, we can interpret The entropy as the average amount of surprise from observing $X$. For example, imagine that a slot machine system emits statistical independently symbols ${s_1, \\ldots, s_k}$ with probabilities ${p_1, \\ldots, p_k}$ respectively. Then the entropy of this system equals to the average self-information from observing each output, i.e.,\n",

    "$$H(S) = \\sum_i {p_i \\cdot I(s_i)} = - \\sum_i {p_i \\cdot \\log p_i}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties of Entropy\n",
    "\n",
    "By the above examples and interpretations, we can derive the following properties of entropy. Here, we refer to X as an event and P as the probability distribution of X.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Entropy is non-negative, i.e., $H(X) \\geq 0, \\forall X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $X \\sim P$ with a p.d.f. or a p.m.f. $p(x)$, and we try to estimate $P$ by a new probability distribution $Q$ with a p.d.f. or a p.m.f. $q(x)$, then $$H(X) = - E_{x \\sim P} [\\log p(x)] \\leq  - E_{x \\sim P} [\\log q(x)], \\text{ with equality if and only if } P = Q.$$  Alternatively, $H(X)$ gives a lower bound of the average number of bits needed to encode symbols drawn from $P$.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If $X \\sim P$, then $x$ conveys the maximum amount of information if it spreads evenly among all possible outcomes. Specifically, if the probability distribution $P$ is discrete with $k$-class $\\{p_1, \\ldots, p_k \\}$, then $$H(X) \\leq \\log(k), \\text{ with equality if and only if } p_i = \\frac{1}{k}, \\forall x_i.$$ If $P$ is a continuous random variable, then the story becomes much more complicated.  However, if we additionally impose that $P$ is supported on a finite interval (with all values between $0$ and $1$), then $P$ has the highest entropy if it is the uniform distribution on that interval.\n",

    "## Mutual Information\n",

    "Previously we defined entropy of a single random variable $X$, how about the entropy of a pair random variables $(X,Y)$?

Is there redundant information, or is it all unique?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "For the following discussion, we always use $(X,Y)$ as a pair of random variables that follows a joint probability distribution $P$ with a p.d.f. or a p.m.f. $p_{X,Y}(x,y)$, while $X$ and $Y$ follow probability distribution $p_X(x)$ and $p_Y(y)$, respectively. \n",

    "The joint entropy defined above the amount of information contained in a pair of random variables.  This is useful, but often times it is not what we care about.  Consider the setting of machine learning.  Let us take $X$ to be the random variable (or vector of random variables) that describes the pixel values of an image, and $Y$ to be the random variable which is the class label.  $X$ should contain substantial information---a natural image is a complex thing.  However, the information contained in $Y$ once the image has been show should be low.  Indeed, the image of a digit should already contain the information about what digit it is unless the digit is illegible.  Thus, to continue to extend our vocabulary of information theory, we need to be able to reason about the information content in a random variable conditional on another.\n",

When we need to disambiguate \"Amazon\", we can compare which group has more occurrence in the context of the word Amazon.
