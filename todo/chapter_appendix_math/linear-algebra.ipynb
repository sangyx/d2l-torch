    "This mirrors the fact that the majority of data we encounter is in this format.\n",
    "This dichotomy in notation is ubiquitous in machine learning literature,\n",
    "so we match it while recognizing that it can be a bit cumbersome to the beginner.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a vector, the first interpretation \n",
    "that we should give it is as a point in space. \n",
    "In two or three dimensions, we can visualize these points \n",

    "Not only can we think of the vector $\\mathbf{v} = [2,3]^\\top$ \n",

    "Lets take $\\mathbf{b}_1 = [2,4]^\\top$ and $\\mathbf{b}_2 = [-1,-2]^\\top$ \n",
    "be the two columns of $\\mathbf{B}$.\n",
    "Remember that we can write everything transformed by the matrix $\\mathbf{B}$\n",
    "as a weighted sum of the columns of the matrix: \n",
    "like $a_1\\mathbf{b}_1 + a_2\\mathbf{b}_2$.\n",
    "We call this a *linear combination*. \n",
    "The fact that $\\mathbf{b}_1 = -2\\cdot\\mathbf{b}_2$ \n",

    "This should not surprise us too much \n",
    "since we already saw that this matrix \n",
    "collapses the entire plane down into a single line.\n",
    "Moreover, we see that the linear dependence \n",
    "$\\mathbf{b}_1 = -2\\cdot\\mathbf{b}_2$ captures this. \n",

    "A concept known as the *rank* will be our answer.\n",
    "In the previous section, we noted that a linear dependence\n",

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "We now see exactly what we hoped for!\n",
    "After normalizing the matrices by the principle eigenvalue,\n",
    "we see that the random data does not explode as before,\n",
    "but rather eventually equilibrates to a specific value.\n",
    "It would be nice to be able to do these things from first principles,\n",
    "and it turns out that if we look deeply at the mathematics of it,\n",
    "we can see that the largest eigenvalue \n",
    "of a large random matrix with independent mean zero,\n",
    "variance one Gaussian entries is on average about $\\sqrt{n}$,\n",
    "or in our case $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.2$,\n",
    "due to a fascinating fact known as the [circular law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_law).\n",
    "This is why almost all initialization strategies\n",
    "are of the format of [Gaussians divided by the square root of the number of inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08863).\n",
    "In this way, eigenvalues form a key component\n",
    "for understanding the behavior of many ML systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tensors and Common Linear Algebra Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "In :numref:`sec_scalar-tensor` the concept of tensors was introduced.\n",
    "In this section, we will dive more deeply into tensor contractions \n",
    "(the tensor equivalent of matrix multiplication),\n",
    "and see how it can provide a unified view \n",
    "on a number of matrix and vector operations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "With matrices and vectors we knew how to multiply them to transform data.\n",
    "We need to have a similar definition for tensors if they are to be useful to us.\n",
    "Think about matrix multiplication:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{C} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or equivalently\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ c_{i,j} = \\sum_{k} a_{i,k}b_{k,j}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This pattern is one we can repeat for tensors.\n",
    "For tensors, there is no one case of what \n",
    "to sum over that can be universally chosen,\n",
    "so we need specify exactly which indices we want to sum over.\n",
    "For instance we could consider\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{il} = \\sum_{jk} x_{ijkl}a_{jk}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Such a transformation is called a *tensor contraction*.\n",
    "It can represent a far more flexible family of transformations\n",
    "that matrix multiplication alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a often-used notational simplification, \n",
    "we can notice that the sum is over exactly those indices\n",
    "that occur more than once in the expression,\n",
    "thus people often work with *Einstein notation*,\n",
    "where the summation is implicitly taken over all repeated indices.\n",
    "This gives the compact expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y_{il} = x_{ijkl}a_{jk}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Examples from Linear Algebra\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us see how many of the linear algebraic definitions \n",
    "we have seen before can be expressed in this compressed tensor notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{w} = \\sum_i v_iw_i$ \n",
    "* $\\|\\mathbf{v}\\|_2^{2} = \\sum_i v_iv_i$\n",
    "* $(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{v})_i = \\sum_j a_{ij}v_j$\n",
    "* $(\\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{B})_{ik} = \\sum_j a_{ij}b_{jk}$\n",
    "* $\\mathrm{tr}(\\mathbf{A}) = \\sum_i a_{ii}$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we can replace a myriad of specialized notations with short tensor expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expressing in numpy\n",
    "Tensors may flexibly be operated on in code as well.\n",
    "As seen in :numref:`sec_scalar-tensor`, \n",
    "we can create tensors using numpy arrays."

    "## Summary\n",
    "* Vectors can be interpreted geometrically as either points or directions in space.\n",
    "* Dot products define the notion of angle to arbitrarily high-dimensional spaces.\n",
    "* Hyperplanes are high-dimensional generalizations of lines and planes.  They can be used to define decision planes that are often used as the last step in a classification task.\n",
    "* Matrix multiplication can be geometrically interpreted as uniform distortions of the underlying coordinates. They represent a very restricted, but mathematically clean, way to transform vectors.\n",
    "* Linear dependence is a way to tell when a collection of vectors are in a lower dimensional space than we would expect (say you have $3$ vectors living in a $2$-dimensional space). The rank of a matrix is the size of the largest subset of its columns that are linearly independent.\n",
    "* When a matrix's inverse is defined, matrix inversion allows us to find another matrix that undoes the action of the first. Matrix inversion is useful in theory, but requires care in practice owing to numerical instability.\n",
    "* Determinants allow us to measure how much a matrix expands or contracts a space. A nonzero determinant implies an invertible (non-singular) matrix and a zero-valued determinant means that the matrix is non-invertible (singular).\n",
    "* Eigenvalues and eigenvectors allow for a detailed understanding of the behavior of a matrix.\n",
    "* Tensor contractions and Einstein summation provide for a neat and clean notation for expressing many of the computations that are seen in machine learning.\n",
