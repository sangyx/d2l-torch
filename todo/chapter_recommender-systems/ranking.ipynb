    "# Personalized Ranking for Recommender Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "In the former sections, only explicit feedback was considered and models were trained and tested on observed ratings only.  There are two demerits of such methods: First, most feedback is not explicit but implicit in real-world scenarios, and explicit feedback can be more expensive to collect.  Second,  non-observed user-item pairs which may be predictive for users' interests are totally ignored, making these methods unsuitable for cases where ratings are not missing at random but because of users' preferences.  Non-observed user-item pairs are a  mixture of real negative feedback (users are not interested in the items) and missing values (the user might interact with the items in the future). We simply ignore the non-observed pairs in matrix factorization and AutoRec. Clearly, these models are incapable of distinguishing between observed and non-observed pairs and are usually not suitable for personalized ranking tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, a class of recommendation models targeting at generating ranked recommendation lists from implicit feedback have gained popularity. In general, personalized ranking models can be optimized with pointwise, pairwise or Listwise approaches. Pointwise approaches considers a single interaction at a time and train a classifier/regressor to predict individual preferences. Matrix factorization and AutoRec are optimized with pointwise objectives. Pairwise approaches consider a pair of items for each user and aim to approximate the optimal ordering for that pair. Usually, pairwise approaches are more suitable for the ranking task because predicting relative order is reminiscent to the nature of ranking. Listwise approaches approximate the ordering of the entire list of items, for example, direct optimizing the ranking measures such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain ([NDCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain)). However, listwise approaches are more complex and compute-intensive than pointwise or pairwise approaches. In this section, we will introduce two pairwise objectives/losses, Bayesian Personalized Ranking loss and Hinge loss, and their respective implementations.\n",

    "Bayesian personalized ranking (BPR) is a pairwise personalized ranking loss that is derived from the maximum posterior estimator. It has been widely used in many existing recommendation models. The training data of BPR consists of both positive and negative pairs (missing values). It assumes that the user prefers the positive item over all other non-observed items.\n",
    "\n",
    "In formal, the training data is constructed by tuples in the form of $(u, i, j)$, which represents that the user $u$ prefers the item $i$ over the item $j$. The Bayesian formulation of BPR which aims to maximize the posterior probability is given below:\n",

We can formultae the maximum posterior estimator to derive the generic optimization criterion for the personalized ranking task.\n",
